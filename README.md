# Some experiments on neural networks and deep learning

In this repository, some techniques for improving neural networks and deep learning are described, implemented and tried out. 

## Content

MNIST Experiments:

* Use MC dropout for improving classification (`mc_dropout.ipynb`)

Regression uncertainty:

* Train simple model on Boston Housing Price dataset and estimate uncertainties of predictions (`UncertaintyEstimationRegression.ipynb`)
